## Description <a name="description"> </a>

**Galmetry** is a rust crate that implements the most famous algorithms about computational geometry.

The crate is composed by 2 modules:
- **geometry**: in this package there are all the structs rapresenting geometry stuff. If you need to model some geometrical data, you can pick a struct from here. 

- **algorithm**: in this package I'll put all the algorithms related to *computational geometry* topic. You can find the current state of the implementation in the [roadmap](##roadmap)


## Roadmap <a name="roadmap"> </a>
